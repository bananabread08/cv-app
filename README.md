# Project: CV Maker (Curriculum Vitae Maker)

The CV Project for TOP (The Odin Project)

## Features and Functionalities

- Create a CV/Resume by inputting information on respective section forms.
- Edit submitted information
- Ability to save and / or print as `.pdf`.

## Objectives and Outcomes

Project is mainly my first real React project. It is made to practice React concepts like handling `States and Props` and `Lifting the State Up`. It was hard at first and can't really grasp the idea of handling JS and HTML (in the form of JSX) at the same time. It was fun and I enjoyed "thinking in React". This is currently version 2 and I improved the responsiveness on mobile and for larger screens.

## Usage / Running the Project Locally

1. Clone the repository.
2. Update node_modules. Run `npm install` to project directory.
3. Run the project. Run `npm start`.
4. Fill any of the corresponding forms to edit the corresponding preview. (i.e edit General Info to change the General Info preview)
5. Add more or remove Work Experience and Schools using the dedicated add button (see Add Button on corresponding sections).
6. Export as PDF when you are done.

## Development

Made with mainly ReactJS and `create-react-app`.

- React / CRA
- `styled-components`
- `flaticon` for the icons

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
